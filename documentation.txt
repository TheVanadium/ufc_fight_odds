fighter_data_sorter.py sorts all the data from UFC 2 to Brunson vs. Holland

fight data is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata

it adds fights and calculates elos and all that stuff

(test_)fighter_data.csv:
json:
"fighter name": {
    "elo": (float),
    "record": {
        "date1": {
            "opponent": (str),
            "result": (str),
            "weight class": (str),
        },
        ...
    }
}

the fighter names don't have accents because of the dataset i used
i'll have to come up with a more robust system to fix the accent problem, as accents are hard to read
