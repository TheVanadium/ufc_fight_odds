fighter_data_sorter.py sorts all the data from UFC 2 to Brunson vs. Holland

fight data is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata

it adds fights and calculates elos and all that stuff

(test_)fighter_data.csv:
csv: fighter, elo, record
record is a dict, so it was probably a better idea to use json
i'll refactor it at some point

the fighter names don't have accents because of the dataset i used
i'll have to come up with a more robust system to fix the accent problem, as accents are hard to read
