# UFC Fight Prediction Generator
In Progress

## Purpose
To generate strong and accurate predictions for UFC fights based on the fighters' previous fights (because I'm cheap and don't want to pay for a UFC fight API)

Input: Two fighters' names <br>
Output: A prediction of the winner and the probability of that fighter winning
